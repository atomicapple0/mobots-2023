## What is Mobots?
Mobots is an annual tradition at CMU during Carnival where competitors build minitaure robots which race on a sidewalk outsiode of Wean hall. The robots must navigate the course, typically by following the white painted line, and go through each numbered gate in order as fast as possible.
